<p class="Header">PyTom: Align projections and reconstruct a tomogram</p>
<h2 id="General">Overview</h2>
Pytom currently supports the alignment of projections by fiducials
and reconstruction by weighted backprojection. Both, alignment by
gold beads and reonstruction by weighted backprojection are still
the most common approaches in the field. Nevertheless, we are working on the 
implementation of further alignment and reconstruction methods.
<h2 id="Background">Theoretical Background</h2>
<h3 id="Alignment">Alignment of tilt series</h3>
<p align="justify">
Prior to a 3D reconstruction projections must be aligned to 
a common coordinate system because despite the best efforts to keep the feature 
of interest in the center during acquisition movement is inevitable. Moreover,
the electron optical lense system causes image rotations and even subtle
focus-dependent magnification changes, which need to be compensated for.</p>
<p align="justify">
Currently, PyTom only supports alignment by fiducials (gold beads). The positions
of markers in the projection images need to be provided in an EM-file. This
file can be obtained by interactive marker localization in the <code>TOM/AV3</code> 
or <code>EM</code> packages. There is also a function in AV3 to convert IMOD 
marker files to an EM file (av3_wimp2em.m).</p>
<p align="justify">
The PyTom alignment function simply minimizes the residual error of the 
coordinates projected from a 3D model and the oberserved coordinates in the
projections. In more detail, 3D coordinates of the marker model, the projection 
shifts, and the image rotation is first computed using an analytical approach,
in which a constant rotation (=tilt axis) and magnification is assumed 
(<code>TiltAlignment.computeCoarseAlignment</code>). This
function determines a tilt axis (to x-axis) between 0 and 180 degrees; by definition
for a tilt axis x there is a second solution, x+180 deg, that would satisfy the 
marker equations equally well. You need prior knowledge to decide, which tilt
axis is correct - assuming the wrong tilt axis will yield reconstructions
with the inverted handedness. In the alignment it can be specified if the solution
180&lt;x&lt;360 deg is supposed to be correct rather than the default solution 
0&lt;x&lt;180 (handflip=True).</p>
<p align="justify">
To determine the 3D coordinate system of the markers the coordinates of one 
marker point need to be defined. Thus, a reference marker needs to be chosen 
(<code>irefmark</code>). To this marker reference coordinates (<code>r</code>) 
can be assigned or default values can be chosen. The default value is 
<code>r=(x_iref-center,y_iref-center,0)</code>. <code>x_iref</code> and 
<code>y_iref</code> are the coordinates of the marker in a reference projection
<code>iref</code>. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
After approximate determination of the image rotations, translations, and 3D
coordinates of the markers an optimization algorithm 
(<code>TiltAlignment.alignFromFiducials</code>) determines the tilt-angle specific image 
rotation, tilt-angle specific magnification, and again translations and 3D coordinates. 
For the reference projection <code>iref</code> the magnification is defined as 1.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The projections are aligned by inverse application of the determined translations, 
rotations, and magnifications to each projection. The transformation is carried
out as a single interpolation in real space (default interpolation method: 
3rd order spline).
</p>
<h3 id="weighting">Weighting of projections</h3>
<p align="justify">
If a tomogram were reconstructed from the unprocessed projections the low-frequency
information would be artificially enhanced as illustrated in Fig.1. To obtain
a truthful 3D image the information below the so-called Crowther frequency
need to be attenuated. This is accomplished by weighting the projections in 
Fourier space proportional to its frequency perpendicular to the tilt axis.
This can be approximated as a 'ramp' function (analytical weighting). A more 
accurate weighting scheme would be to explicitly compute the overlapping information
in Fourier space (exact weighting, not yet implemented in PyTom).
In many cases it makes sense to furthermore apply a low-pass filter
to the data to eliminate noise, which is dominant in the higher frequencies.

<strong>Fig. 1.</strong>Sampling of Fourier space by projections in 2D. The
Fourier transform of each projection samples a slice of Fourier space
(black lines); its normal is determined by the tilt angle. The signal
‘leak’ of each sample point into the neighboring area is reciprocally
proportional to the diameter D of the object. For reconstruction, the
Fourier coefficients on the 3D grid (intersected lines) need to be
approximated from the sampling points of the projections by an
appropriate algorithm. In principle, the 3D signal can be
reconstructed without any gaps to a resolution k_C if the entire tilt
range of +/-90 deg was accessible. Restricting the tilting to +/-90 deg 
gives rise to a ‘missing wedge’.
</p>
<h3 id="rec3d">3D Reconstruction of tomogram</h3>
<p align="justify">
In PyTom reconstructions are performed using backprojection. The algorithm can
use different interpolation kernels. By default we use a 3rd order spline.
</p>

<h2 id="practical">Reconstruct a tomogram using <code>reconstructTomogram.py</code> </h2>
<p align="justify">
In our <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial data-set</a> you will find a 
directory <code>reconstructTomo</code> where you can perform reconstruction 
of a full tomogram by weighted backprojection.
Projections will be aligned and weighted during this step so that the 
data you start with are unaligned and unweighted projections. 
Essentially raw projections only sorted according to the tilt angle.
Running this script will generate a full <code>tomogram.em</code> file, 
either 2x binned (4x downscaled) (<code>512,512,128</code>) or in 
original size (<code>2048,2048,512</code>). The alignment will be 
determined based on the coordinates of fiducials clicked in the Matlab
TOM toolbox. Alternatively, you can use coordinates from <a href="#imod">
IMOD</a>.
</p>
The <code>reconstructTomo.sh</code> is essentially the only script you 
have to run to obtain the aligned, weighted projections and the 2x binned tomogram.

<a id="imod"><h2>Reconstruct using Marker coordinates from <em>IMOD</em></h2></a>
<p align="justify">
<a href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/" target="_blank">IMOD</a> is a common
program for reconstruction of electron tomograms. In particular, it has handy
functionality for tracking fiducial markers and features. The coordinates of
these features can be used for alignment in pytom, as described in the
following. From the files automatically generated during alignment with
<em>etomo</em> the marker coordinates for later use in PyTom can be obtained.
</p>
<h3><a id="wimp">Creating a <em>WIMP</em> file containing the marker coordinates</a></h3>
<p align="justify">
You will need one file from IMOD for reconstruction containing the coordinates
of the markers in the un-transformed tiltseries: the <em>WIMP</em> file. IMOD
itself by default makes use of a pre-transformed tiltseries according to
a crude pre-alignment of the tiltseries (see also: <a
href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/doc/man/tiltalign.html#TOP" target="_blank">
tiltalign documentation</a>). Thus, in order to get the raw
marker coordimates you need to transform them back, either in PyTom or the built-in
IMOD functions. IMOD will internally store the marker coordinates in a
<code>.fid</code> file and the pre-transformation in a
<code>.prexg</code> file. Moreover, the marker coordinates are stored in a coordinate
    system that is pre-shifted compared to the original files. The pre-shift binning value is
    somewhat hidden in the advanced options of the preprocessing tab in IMOD.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    If you transform the marker coordinates in PyTom everything is straightforward. You obtain the WIMP files using
    3dmod:
    <ol>
        <li>Start 3dmod by typing <code>3dmod</code> in the command line.
        </li>
        <li>Select the model file (<code>myTiltSeries.fid</code>), which is generated by the <code>etomo</code>
            workflow.
        </li>
        <li>Press 'OK'.
        </li>
        <li>A viewer for the tilt series and the small 3dmod window opens.
        </li>
        <li>Save WIMP file in the 3dmod window using menu: File -> Write Model As -> Wimp.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p align="justify">
Alternatively you can convert the coordinates using imod tools, which is mentioned for the sake of completeness here:
    To convert the pre-transformed marker coordinates
back to their original values the following IMOD programs can be
used from the command line (see also: <a
href="http://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/doc/man/xfmodel.html#TOP"
target="_blank">xfmodel</a>):
<div class="codeFragment">
  <code>
xfmodel -back -prealign myTiltSeries.prexg -input myTiltSeries.fid -o myTiltSeries_raw.fid
  </code>
</div>
For tiltseries <code>myTiltSeries</code>, this command will generate a
<code>.fid</code> file with back-transformed marker coordinates (=
<code>myTiltSeries_raw.fid</code>). In case you worked with binned
images in the IMOD alignment you will also need to revert the binning. For
example, the command would be the following for selection scale=1/8
(1/binimod):
<div class="codeFragment">
  <code>
xfmodel -back -scale 0.1250 -prealign myTiltSeries.prexg -input myTiltSeries.fid -o myTiltSeries_raw.fid
  </code>
</div>
The <code>_raw.fid</code> file can now be converted into an <em>WIMP</em> file in
<code>3dmod</code> from the IMOD package:
<ol>
  <li>Start 3dmod by typing <code>3dmod</code> in the command line.
  </li>
  <li>Select the raw model file (the <code>myTiltSeries_raw.fid</code>, which was just generated). If you need to
      revert binning make sure you select model and also tilt series- otherwise the magnification is somehow not
      taken into account - weird ...
  </li>
  <li>Press 'OK'.
  </li>
  <li>A viewer for the tilt series and the small 3dmod window opens.
  </li>
  <li>Save WIMP file in the 3dmod window using menu: File -> Write Model As -> Wimp.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<a id="recwimp"><h3>Tomogram Alignment from WIMP file</h3></a>
<p align="justify">
    The <a href="#rec3d">reconstruction script</a> now supports alignment from WIMP files. Just specify the WIMP file
    as the markerfile instead of an EM markerfile and there you go. Additionally, you may often need to specify the
    tilt angles in the form of a tlt file because they are typically not stored anywhere in the header.
</p>

<h2>Reconstruct a tomogram using <em>INFR</em> algorithm</h2>
<p align="justify">
Now PyTom also includes the support of a new reconstruction algorithm called 
Iterative Nonuniform fast Fourier transform based Reconstruction method 
(<em>INFR</em>). For more details about this algorithm, please check: 
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104784771300316X">
Iterative reconstruction of cryo-electron tomograms using nonuniform fast 
Fourier transforms, Y. Chen et al., JSB 2014.</a>
</p>
<p>
The way to use it is simple:
<div class="codeFragment">
    <code>pytom PathToPytom/reconstruction/reconstruct_INFR.py</code>
</div>
It requires the following parameters:
<ul>
  <li><strong>-d</strong>: The directory name, in which all the aligned and 
  unweighted projections are stored. Note that the projections should be EM 
  format and the tilt angle information must be specified in the headers!
  </li>
  <li><strong>-i</strong>: Optional, the number of iterations to run. 10 by 
  default.
  </li>
  <li><strong>-o</strong>: Output filename.</li>
</ul>
Note that INFR requires a lot of memory. Currently it is limited to 
<em>1k x 1k</em> projections on most computers (i.e., depending on the amount
of memory you have). 
</p>
To create the aligned projections you can also use PyTom. Simply use the <a href="#rec3d">script</a>
for WBP reconstruction, but omit weighting and reconstruction
(<em>--weightingType 0</em>):
<div class="codeFragment">
    <code>
    <pre>
    pytom PathToPytom/bin/reconstructTomogram.py --tiltSeriesPath MyTiltSeriesDir \
        --tiltSeriesPrefix NameOfTiltSeriesFiles --firstIndex 1 --lastIndex MyLastIndex \
        --referenceIndex MyReferenceProjectionIndex --markerFile MyMarkerFile \
        --referenceMarkerIndex MyReferenceMarkerIndex --projectionTargets \
        MyFileNameOfAlignedProjections --projectionBinning MyBinning --weightingType 0
    </pre>
    </code>
</div>


<h2>Basic interactive manipulation of volumes</h2>
<p align="justify">
Sometimes you might want to do simple things on your reconstructed tomogram like
reducing its size or low-pass filtering it without reconstructing it again.
Here is an example how to reduce the size in <em>z</em>:
</p>
<p align="justify">
<div class="codeFragment">
<code>
$ipytom<br/>
from pytom.lib.pytom_volume import read, subvolume<br/>
v = read('tomogram.em')<br/>
#this function will cut out a subvolume the size 512,512,256 out of the original volume starting at position 0,0,128<br/>
s = subvolume(v,0,0,128,512,512,256) <br/>
s.write('subVolume.em')</code>
</div>
</p>
<p align="justify">
Make sure you store the position at which the subvolume was cut. This will coordinate is 
required for reconstructing subtomograms at full resolution (see <a 
href="reconstructSubtomograms.html">Reconstruct Subtomograms Tutorial</a>).
</p>
<p align="justify">
If you want to lowpass filter the tomogram / subvolume to a specified resolution you can do that 
interactively as well:
</p>
<p align="justify">
<div class="codeFragment">
  <code>
  $ipytom
  volume = read('subvolume.em')<br/>
  from pytom.basic.filter import lowpassFilter<br/>
  filteredVolume = lowpassFilter(volume,100,10)[0] #filter the volume to the 100th 
  pixel in Fourier space with 10 pixel smoothing<br/>
  filteredVolume.write('filteredVolume.em')
  </code>
</div>
</p>
